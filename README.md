# Welcome to my 4th year react native app ðŸ‘‹

This is the front-end code in my react native application.

## FlavourFind 

This app makes it easier for users to find new recipes and share their own.
Users have full crud functionality to recipes, where they can also favourite ones they like or will want to make in the future

### Backend
The backend was created using JS as well and can be found [here](https://github.com/N00212272/recipeBackend)
